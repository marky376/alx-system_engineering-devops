# Web Infrastructure Design

## Introduction
This README provides an overview of the web infrastructure design for our project. It outlines the architecture, components, and technologies used to ensure a scalable and reliable web application.

## Architecture
Our web infrastructure follows a distributed architecture to handle high traffic and provide fault tolerance. It consists of the following components:

1. Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and prevent overload.
2. Web Servers: Host the web application and handle user requests.
3. Database Servers: Store and manage the application's data.
4. Caching Servers: Improve performance by caching frequently accessed data.
5. Content Delivery Network (CDN): Delivers static content to users from geographically distributed servers.

## Deployment Process
To deploy our web infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. Set up the necessary AWS resources, including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and CloudFront distribution.
2. Configure the load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across the web servers.
3. Deploy the web application on the web servers using LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
4. Set up the database servers and configure replication for data redundancy.
5. Configure caching servers to improve performance.
6. Integrate the CDN to deliver static content efficiently.

## Conclusion
This README provides an overview of our web infrastructure design, including the architecture, LAMP stack, and deployment process. By following these guidelines, we can ensure a scalable, reliable, and high-performance web application.
