A commit message on networking bassic: OSI Model:
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication or network system into seven abstraction layers. It is a guide for product developers and facilitates communication between different systems.

Layers: The OSI model has seven layers, from the physical layer (Layer 1) to the application layer (Layer 7).
Organization: The layers are organized in a hierarchical manner, each layer interacting with the layers directly above and below it.
LAN (Local Area Network):
Definition: A LAN is a network that is limited to a small geographic area, such as a single building or a campus.
Typical Usage: LANs are used for connecting computers and devices within a localized area, facilitating resource sharing and communication.
WAN (Wide Area Network):
Definition: A WAN is a network that covers a broad area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.
Typical Usage: WANs connect LANs over larger distances and are commonly used for long-distance communication between geographically dispersed offices.
Internet:
Definition: The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and networks that use standardized communication protocols.
IP Address:
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
Types of IP Address:
IPv4: The most widely used version of IP addresses, expressed as four sets of numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
IPv6: A newer version with a much larger address space, expressed as eight groups of hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
Localhost:
It refers to the loopback network interface, typically designated by the IP address 127.0.0.1, allowing a device to connect to itself.
Subnet:
A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. It helps manage and optimize network traffic.
IPv6 Creation:
IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses due to the rapid expansion of the internet and the increasing number of connected devices.
TCP/UDP:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Offers faster, connectionless communication but may not guarantee delivery.
Mainly Used Data Transfer Protocols for IP:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
TCP vs. UDP:
Main Difference: TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of information, while UDP is faster but doesn't guarantee delivery.
Port:
A port is a communication endpoint identified by a numerical value within a device's operating system.
Port Numbers:
SSH (Secure Shell): 22
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): 80
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): 443
Tool/Protocol for Checking Network Connection:
Ping: Often used to check if a device is connected to a network.
