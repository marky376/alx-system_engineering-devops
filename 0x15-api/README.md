## What Bash Scripting Should Not Be Used For:

Bash scripting is like magic spells for your computer, but just like magic, it has its limits. Here are things you shouldn't try with Bash scripting:
- Playing games or making fancy apps with graphics. Bash is more about organizing tasks on your computer, like sorting files and running programs.
- Doing heavy math or complex calculations. Bash isn't as fast or powerful as other languages for number crunching.
- Making things work on every computer. Bash is best for Unix-like systems, and it might not play nice with other operating systems.

## What is an API?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are like secret codes that different programs use to talk to each other. They let apps share information and do tasks together. Imagine an API as a menu in a restaurant – it tells you what you can order and how to ask for it.

## What is a REST API?

A REST API is a type of API that uses a set of rules to make communication between computers super easy. It's like a recipe for making the perfect sandwich – it tells you what ingredients to use and how to put them together. REST APIs usually work over the internet using standard web protocols like HTTP.

## What are Microservices?

Microservices are like tiny teams of specialists in a big company. Instead of having one huge program that does everything, microservices break tasks into smaller pieces. Each piece focuses on doing one thing really well and talks to the others through APIs. This makes everything faster, more flexible, and easier to manage.

## What is the CSV Format?

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple way to store data in a text file. It's like making a list of items separated by commas. For example:
```
Name, Age, City
John, 25, New York
Emma, 30, London
```

## What is the JSON Format?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is another way to store data, but it's easier for computers to understand. It's like writing notes in a language that both you and your computer can read. For example:
```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 25,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

## Pythonic Naming Conventions:

When you're coding in Python, it's good to follow these naming rules to keep things organized:

- **Package and Module Names:** Use lowercase names, and separate words with underscores (e.g., `my_package`, `my_module.py`).
- **Class Names:** Use CapWords (CamelCase) – start with an uppercase letter and capitalize the first letter of each word (e.g., `MyClass`).
- **Variable Names:** Use lowercase names, and separate words with underscores (e.g., `my_variable`).
- **Function Names:** Use lowercase names, and separate words with underscores (e.g., `my_function()`).
- **Constant Names:** Use uppercase names, and separate words with underscores (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).
