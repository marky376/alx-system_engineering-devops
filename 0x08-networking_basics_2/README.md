A commit on learning networking basics #1: Localhost/127.0.0.1:
Localhost: Refers to the loopback network interface on a device.
127.0.0.1: The IP address assigned to the localhost, allowing a device to communicate with itself. It is often used for testing and diagnostics.
0.0.0.0:
0.0.0.0: In the context of networking, it typically represents an unspecified or unknown address. When used as a listening address for a server, it usually means the server will accept connections from any available network interface.
/etc/hosts:
/etc/hosts: A system file on Unix-like operating systems that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It allows users to manually associate IP addresses with domain names, bypassing the need for DNS resolution.
Displaying Active Network Interfaces:
On Linux, you can use the ifconfig or ip addr command to display information about active network interfaces. For example:
bash
Copy code
ifconfig
or
bash
Copy code
ip addr
On Windows, you can use the ipconfig command in the Command Prompt:
cmd
Copy code
ipconfig
On macOS, you can use the ifconfig or networksetup command:
bash
Copy code
ifconfig
or
bash
Copy code
networksetup -listallhardwareports
These commands provide information about the active network interfaces, including their IP addresses, MAC addresses, and other relevant details. Keep in mind that the specific commands may vary based on your operating system.
